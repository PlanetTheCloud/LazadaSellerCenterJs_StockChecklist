# Insatallation
Inject to page with extensions like [User Javascript and CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld/).

# Usage
**NOTE**: Although this is meant to be used on older version of Seller Center, this also works on the newer version minus the sytling.  

Select all or few orders and print Stock Checklist / Item Picklist.  
You can then select the items by clicking on their picture/image.  
Selected items will be highlighted with green background color.  
On the top-left corner, the button "Open Selected" will be shown and clicking on it will open a new tab with the items selected.  

# Use Cases
For dropshipping sellers with a multiple suppliers, counting the items one-by-one or typing it out will take time. Using this system can help sellers to just select the images to get specific items and then forward the page to the supplier for deliveries.
